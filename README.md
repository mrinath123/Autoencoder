# Autoencoder
Here MNIST dataset is been given some noise and then we denoise it using Convolutional Autoencoder. Here I am not using the latest version of Tensorflow,so may be some syntatical error may come up to you.
Hope it helps!

(Tensorflow version :-1.13.1 )

In EncDec2020 I changed the model architecture, plus I added  dense_layers after the encoder layer for classifing the 
digits, after training the autoencoder.
